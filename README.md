 🔐 Windows Security Log Parser (Blue Team)

A simple and beginner-friendly **Python log parser** designed for **blue team / SOC learning**.  
This project parses **Windows Security and Sysmon-style logs**, structures them into tables, and detects basic security threats such as **brute-force login attempts**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Practice **log analysis fundamentals**
- Understand **Windows Security Event IDs**
- Apply **SOC-style detection logic**
- Build a small but realistic **blue team portfolio project**

---

## 🧱 Data Model (Tables)

This project organizes logs into structured tables (Python dictionaries):

### 🔑 Authentication Events
Windows Security Logs:
- **4624** — Successful logon
- **4625** — Failed logon

Fields:
- EventID
- Username
- SourceIP
- Status

---

### ⚙️ Process Creation Events
Windows Security / Sysmon:
- **4688** — Process creation

Fields:
- EventID
- Username
- ProcessName

---

### 🚨 Alerts
SOC-style detections generated by the parser.

Fields:
- AlertName
- Severity
- SourceIP
- Count
- Description

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Windows Security Event concepts
- SOC / Blue Team fundamentals

No external libraries required.

## 📄 Sample Log Format

The parser expects logs in a simple text format:

EventID=4625 AccountName=admin SourceIP=10.0.0.5 Status=FAIL
EventID=4624 AccountName=admin SourceIP=192.168.1.10 Status=SUCCESS
EventID=4688 AccountName=SYSTEM ProcessName=powershell.exe


*(This simulates exported Windows Security or Sysmon logs.)*

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MedMassous/windows-log-parser.git
cd windows-log-parser
Run the parser:

python windows_log_parser.py
📊 Output
The script prints:

Parsed authentication events

Process creation events

Detected alerts (e.g. brute-force attempts)

Example alert:

Possible Brute Force | Medium | 10.0.0.5 | 3 failed attempts
🔍 Detection Logic
Brute-Force Detection
Counts failed login attempts (4625) per source IP

Triggers an alert when attempts exceed a threshold

Mimics basic SIEM correlation logic

📚 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, you practice:

Log parsing and normalization

Security event analysis

Detection engineering basics

Blue team / SOC investigation workflows

Python scripting for cybersecurity

📌 Future Improvements
Export tables to CSV

Add Sysmon Event ID 3 (network connections)

Add MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping

Support real EVTX / CSV log exports

Convert script into a CLI tool
